# Neural Network in C
Here's my **first** attempt at creating a rudimental neural network in C
I'm just trying to comprehend how a neural network works, i'm no expert by any means

## About the project
It's a model of _images recognition_, I've chosen this dataset at <a href='https://sci2s.ugr.es/keel/category.php?cat=clas&order=insR#sub2'>this</a> link among many others
I have also converted it to plain text.

## The libraries
I'm making use of two other libraries i've written, they are located in the lib subfolder (<a href='https://github.com/NicoDelle/libMatrices'>Here</a>'s the repo of the matrices' one).
Instruction to correctly compile a c file including those libraries are located in the mak.txt file
